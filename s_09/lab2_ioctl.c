/*
 * Using ioctl() for Anything. (driver)
 *
 * As we commented, one reason for resistance to adding dynamic system
 * calls it that the ioctl() system call can already be used for
 * almost any purpose.
 *
 * One minor drawback is that you have to have a device node and write
 * a user application to access the node and pass ioctl() commands to
 * it.
 *
 * For those of you who know how to do a character driver, write a
 * very very brief character driver that has only an ioctl() entry
 * point.  (You don't even need open() or release()).
 *
 * Write a companion program that shows how you can use it.
