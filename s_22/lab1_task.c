/*
 * Priorities and Timeslices
 *
 * Construct a program that is cpu-intensive, and takes at least 5-10
 ^ seconds to run under normal conditions.
 *    
 * Feed it a nice increment (which can range from -20 to +19) as an
 * argument (you'll have to be superuser to feed negative increments)
 * and have the program call nice() to change its priority.
 *    
 * Have the program, as its last step, open the file
 * /proc/[pid]/schedstat, and read in the three integer values, which
 * correspond to:
 *        
 *   The time spent scheduled in and executing.
 *   The time spent sleeping.
 *   The number of times the process was scheduled in.
 *    
 * where the time units are nanoseconds.
 *    
 * From these values compute the average time slice in the process was
 * granted while holding the CPU.
 *    
 * You may want to separately compute the time executing with the use
 * of gettimeofday().
 *    
 * For best results you should start off a bunch of instances with
 * different priorities simultaneously, so they have to schedule
 * against each other. It would also be a good idea to keep the CPU
 * busy with other work, such as by doing a kernel compile.
 *      
 * In the case of a variable speed CPU you may want to fix the
 * frequency before running your tests.
 *    
 * Note: for this program to work the CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS option has to
 * be set in the kernel configuration file.
