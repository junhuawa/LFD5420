/* NOMAKE
 *
 * Changing Signal Priorities. (Solution B)
 *
 * Under the simplest conditions, the kernel dispatches signals to
 * processes in the order in which the signals are received.
 *
 * However, sometimes multiple signals may be blocked for a
 * process. This may happen due to use of sigprocmask(), or when a
 * process is swapped out and multiple signals arrive before it
 * reacquires the CPU.  In these cases, when signal processing resumes
 * the signals are dispatched to the process using a signal selection
 * algorithm in the function next_signal() found in
 * kernel/signal.c. This algorithm selects signals by signal number in
 * ascending order, subject to the limitations of the signal mask.
 *
 * Modify the function next_signal() to select the highest numbered
 * signal first and so on; i.e., it should select signals using a
 * descending order sequence.
 *
 * To keep things simple, you may modify only the branch in
 * next_signal() that pertains to the architecture of your current
 * system: for x86, this means _NSIG_WORDS = 2.
 *
 * You may use the test programs from the first exercise to test your
 * changes to next_signal().
 *
 * Note that POSIX standards do not give complete freedom in the order
 * in which signals should be dealt with.  In particular, real time
 * signals should be dealt with from lowest to highest number, and if
 * more than one similar stop signal is received, only one may be
 * dealt with; the kernel has special handling in this case.
 *
 * You make want to make your changes to the kernel code in such a way
 * that the original algorithm is still used until you are satisfied
 * that the new algorithm works correctly.  Otherwise, the kernel will
 * not boot because signals must work in order to boot.
 *
 * Note: We present solutions as just the new next_signal() functions.
